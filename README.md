# React-plotly-gesture-based-audio-editor

## About this app:
This is WIP project with the objective to create a quick touch/gesture based audio editor app for lay person (Although there's a unique and larger business idea behind it).

The hard part involving audio waveform generation and audio editing has been completed. The next step would be to integrate plotly with react native based soundcloud like app.
