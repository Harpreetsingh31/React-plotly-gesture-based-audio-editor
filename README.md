# React-based Data collection app:
This is WIP project with the objective to create an app for collect Data (focusing on voice data) for say like speech recognition system. User would be able to record voices and calls, then edit them on spot. From their the user would the have to option to transcribe and sell their data.

Prelimianry steps have been taken to built the audio trimmer using react based (Dash) library.

The next step would be to integrate dash with react native (sort of soundcloud like but for data collection app with wallet, profile, and more).
